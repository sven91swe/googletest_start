# googletest_start
A repo with google test set up

Made with several purposes in mind.
* For me to learn a little bit about googletest and CMake.
* For me (and others) to have a starting point for other projects.
* To make scripts to be run in some form of pre-merge check using this framework.
* For me to learn more about GitHub and Jenkins integration. To check commits before merges.
